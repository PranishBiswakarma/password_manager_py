# Password Manager Project

A simple command-line password manager that securely stores passwords using encryption.

## What It Does

- Encrypts passwords using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- Saves encrypted passwords in a file.
- Allows viewing and adding passwords via a simple CLI.

## What I Learned and Used

- Python basics: input handling, file operations, control flow.
- Cryptography with the `cryptography` library (Fernet).
- Key management: generating, saving, and loading keys securely.
- Building user-friendly command-line interfaces.
- Implementing basic encryption and decryption in real projects.
